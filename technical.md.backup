## Tech Stack Recommendations

### Engine Options

**Option 1: Unity (Recommended)**
- **Pros**: Excellent 2D tooling, large asset store, proven for card games
- **Cons**: Larger build size
- **Best for**: Full commercial release

**Option 2: Godot**
- **Pros**: Open source, lightweight, good 2D support
- **Cons**: Smaller community, fewer ready-made assets
- **Best for**: Indie development, smaller scope

**Option 3: Web-Based (Phaser + React)**
- **Pros**: Cross-platform automatically, easy distribution
- **Cons**: Performance limitations, offline play harder
- **Best for**: Browser-first release, rapid prototyping

### Programming Language
- **Unity**: C#
- **Godot**: GDScript or C#
- **Web**: TypeScript/JavaScript

## Animation & VFX

### Essential Animations

#### Card Animations
- **Draw**: Card flies from deck to hand
- **Play**: Card moves from hand to center, flips, effect triggers
- **Discard**: Card flies to discard pile
- **Shuffle**: Deck glows, cards swirl briefly
- **Upgrade**: Card glows gold, transforms

#### Battle Effects
- **Damage**: Red flash on character, confidence bar decreases
- **Heal**: Green pulse, confidence bar increases
- **Buff**: Upward sparkles around character
- **Debuff**: Downward dark particles
- **Charm**: Pink hearts/stars
- **Block**: Blue shield appears

#### Resource Changes
- **₱ Gain**: Coins fly into counter, counter animates up
- **L Gain**: Red envelope appears, sneaky animation
- **U Gain**: Blue handshake icon, warm glow
- **H Gain**: Flame particles, red warning pulse
- **Support Gain**: Crowd cheering animation, bar fills

#### Transition Animations
- **Day Change**: Calendar page flip, sun rises
- **Location Travel**: Map path highlights, character icon moves
- **Event Trigger**: Newspaper headline appears
- **Victory/Defeat**: Confetti or gray overlay

### Performance Considerations
- **Optimize**: Particle systems (limit particles on low-end devices)
- **Toggleable**: Allow players to reduce/disable animations
- **Load times**: Keep animations under 1-2 seconds max
- **Skip option**: Allow ESC/click to skip most animations

---

## Audio Design

### Music Tracks

#### Main Themes (Looping)
1. **Main Menu Theme**: Hopeful, slightly satirical orchestral
2. **Map/Campaign Theme**: Upbeat Filipino folk fusion
3. **Battle Theme (Generic)**: Tense, strategic
4. **Battle Theme (Boss)**: Intense, dramatic
5. **Victory Theme**: Triumphant fanfare
6. **Defeat Theme**: Somber, reflective
7. **Event Theme**: Mysterious, questioning
8. **Scandal Theme**: Ominous, urgent

#### Origin-Specific Themes
- **Strongman**: Military drums, authoritarian
- **Celebrity**: Pop music, glamorous
- **Religious Leader**: Gospel/hymnal, reverent
- **Nepo Baby**: Classical, aristocratic

### Sound Effects

#### UI Sounds
- Button click (satisfying click)
- Button hover (subtle highlight sound)
- Card draw (swoosh)
- Card play (thump, varies by type)
- Resource gain (coins, notifications)
- Heat warning (sizzle, alarm for high Heat)
- Achievement unlock (celebratory chime)

#### Battle Sounds
- Attack cards: Impact, punch, boom
- Defense cards: Shield block, barrier
- Charm cards: Magical chime, sparkle
- Leverage cards: Mechanical, tactical
- Power cards: Dramatic orchestral hit
- Victory: Cheering crowd
- Defeat: Disappointed crowd murmur

#### Ambient Sounds
- **Map**: Birds, city ambiance
- **Locations**: 
  - Church: Choir, bells
  - Market: Crowd chatter, vendors
  - Cockpit: Roosters, crowd roar
  - Office: Keyboard typing, phones

### Voice Acting (Optional)

## Localization

### Target Languages (Priority Order)

1. **English** (Primary)
   - International audience
   - Development language

2. **Filipino/Tagalog** (High Priority)
   - Native audience (most important)
   - Cultural authenticity
   - Many jokes only work in Filipino

3. **Spanish** (Medium Priority)
   - Large market
   - Some cultural overlap

4. **Japanese** (Medium Priority)
   - Strong indie game market

### Localization Challenges

#### Cultural Context
- Many Filipino political terms don't translate directly
- Humor and satire may not land in other cultures
- Regional references specific to Philippines

#### Solutions
- **Glossary**: In-game glossary for Filipino terms
- **Cultural notes**: Optional tooltips explaining context
- **Adaptation**: Localize humor, not just translate
- **Keep Filipino terms**: "Utang na Loob," "Lagay," etc. with explanations

Optimization Strategies
Asset Optimization

Textures: Use texture atlases, compress appropriately
Audio: MP3/OGG for music, WAV for short SFX
Sprites: Sprite sheets for animations
Fonts: Limit font families, use bitmap fonts for small text

Code Optimization

Object pooling: Reuse card objects instead of instantiating
Lazy loading: Load location data only when needed
Caching: Cache frequently accessed data (card stats, etc.)
Async operations: Load assets asynchronously to prevent freezing

Memory Management

Unload unused assets: Clear memory after location changes
Texture streaming: Load high-res textures only when needed
Garbage collection: Minimize allocations in hot paths (battle loops)


Testing Strategy
Test Types
Unit Tests

Card effects: Each card effect works correctly
Resource calculations: ₱, L, U, H, Support math accurate

AI decisions: Opponent AI makes valid moves

Integration Tests

Battle flow: Full battle from start to finish
Campaign flow: Full 45-day run simulation
Save/Load: Data persists correctly
Event chains: Multi-part events resolve properly

Playtesting

Balance testing: Is game too easy/hard?
Fun factor: Are players engaged?
Clarity: Do players understand mechanics?
Bug hunting: Find edge cases

Test Scenarios
Critical Path Tests

Full victory run: Play through entire campaign, win
Full defeat run: Play through, intentionally lose
Scandal survival: Trigger scandal at 100H, survive
All endings: Achieve each ending type
All origins: Win with each origin

Edge Case Tests

Maximum resources: What happens at ₱999,999?
Minimum resources: What happens at negative U?
Heat overflow: What if Heat goes above 100 during event?
Support overflow: What happens above 30,000?
Empty deck: What if player runs out of cards?

Risk Mitigation
Technical Risks
Risk: Performance issues on low-end hardware

Mitigation: Target minimum specs conservatively, optimize early

Risk: Save corruption

Mitigation: Multiple backup saves, robust save system, version checking

Risk: Balance issues

Mitigation: Extensive playtesting, analytics, rapid patching

Business Risks
Risk: Low sales/visibility

Mitigation: Strong marketing, press outreach, demo release, content creator partnerships

Risk: Negative reception to satire

Mitigation: Clear content warnings, emphasize fictional nature, avoid real politician names

Risk: Controversy over political content

Mitigation: Balance satire (criticize all sides equally), focus on systems not individuals

Content Risks
Risk: Cultural insensitivity

Mitigation: Filipino cultural consultants, sensitivity readers, community feedback

Risk: Content becomes dated

Mitigation: Timeless satire of political archetypes rather than current events

Risk: Scope creep

Mitigation: Strict feature prioritization, MVP mindset, post-launch content plan
