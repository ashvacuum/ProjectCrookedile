## Meta Progression Philosophy

### Design Goals
1. **Respect Player Time**: Every run should feel rewarding
2. **Meaningful Unlocks**: Each purchase makes future runs different
3. **Skill Expression**: Meta progression helps, but skill matters most
4. **Replayability**: Hundreds of runs worth of content
5. **Fair Monetization**: All content earnable through play (no pay-to-win)

### Balance Principles
- Legacy perks should be helpful, not overpowered (max ~30% advantage)
- Difficulty modifiers should challenge, not frustrate
- PC earning should be fair (average 200-300 PC per hour)
- Unlocks should open strategies, not trivialize game

---

*Meta progression transforms each run into progress toward long-term mastery.*
