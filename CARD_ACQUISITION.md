# Card Acquisition System

Following the **Slay the Spire** model with 3 card tiers.

## Card Tiers

### Basic Cards
- **Acquisition:** Shops, basic battle rewards, starting decks
- **Power Level:** Starter cards, reliable but not powerful
- **Upgrade:** Basic → Basic+ (via upgrade mechanic at camp/shop)
- **Examples:** Strike, Defend, basic political moves

### Enhanced Cards
- **Acquisition:** Beating normal opponents (rival politicians, journalists)
- **Power Level:** Stronger effects, more strategic options
- **Upgrade:** Enhanced → Enhanced+ (via upgrade mechanic)
- **Examples:** Advanced tactics, special techniques

### Rare Cards
- **Acquisition:**
  - Winning against **crisis events** (scandal defense, assassination attempts)
  - Hitting **campaign thresholds** (50% Influence, Day 30 milestone)
  - **Special events** (TV debates, major victories)
  - **Boss battles** (final rival politician)
- **Power Level:** Game-changing effects, high risk/reward
- **Upgrade:** Rare → Rare+ (via upgrade mechanic)
- **Examples:** Signature moves, ultimate abilities

## Upgrade System

### How Upgrades Work
- **Any card** can be upgraded to its (+) version
- **Costs ₱50** at shops or campfires
- **Same tier:** Basic+ is still Basic tier, Enhanced+ is still Enhanced tier
- **Effects:** ~25% stronger (more damage, more draw, less cost, etc.)

### Examples
- **Intimidate (Basic)** → **Intimidate+ (Basic)**
  - 8 Confidence damage → 10 Confidence damage
- **Smooth Talk (Enhanced)** → **Smooth Talk+ (Enhanced)**
  - Restore 10 Confidence, Draw 1 → Restore 13 Confidence, Draw 2
- **Political Machine (Rare)** → **Political Machine+ (Rare)**
  - Gain 5 Influence, +2H → Gain 7 Influence, +1H

## Design Philosophy

**Tier = Acquisition Difficulty, NOT Power Ceiling**
- Basic+ can be just as useful as Rare in the right deck
- Enhanced cards are your bread and butter mid-game
- Rare cards are rewards for overcoming challenges

**Upgrades are Always Good**
- Never a downside to upgrading
- Strategic choice: which cards to upgrade first?

**Deck Building Strategy**
- Early game: Basic cards, upgrade a few key ones
- Mid game: Replace basics with Enhanced, upgrade those
- Late game: Cherry-pick Rare cards for your strategy
